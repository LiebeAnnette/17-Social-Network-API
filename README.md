# 17-Social-Network-API

edX Bootcamp Homework Challenge 17 - NoSQL

## Description

This is a back-end API for a social network web application built with Express.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose ODM. It allows users to create accounts, post and delete thoughts, react to othersâ€™ thoughts, and manage friend lists. The application demonstrates full CRUD operations for Users and Thoughts, as well as nested CRUD operations for Reactions and Friend relationships.

This API is tested using Insomnia and is structured according to RESTful routing practices.
